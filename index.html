								<b>Kepler KOI Catalog</b><br>
								Kepler closed-out it's mission with a final search of the photometric time series to look for planets. My team used automated tools to vet the signals found to determine which are most consistent with true transiting exoplanets. Because the catalog was automated, we could also vet injected transit signals and simluated false positives. As a result Kepler DR25 KOI catalog of planet candidates is the only one that can be used for to measure occurrence rates of exoplanets in orbits larger than 100 days. 
							</p>
							<p>
							<b>Exoplanet Vetting Tools</b><br>
							We have developed a set of vetting tools that evalute a transit signal and look for evidence that the signal is caused by one of the known false positive scenarios, namely an eclipsing binary or instrumental effects.  The DAVE tools have been run on candidates discovered by the K2 mission and are also being used to evaluate signals from the TESS mission. We are working to simplify the installation of this suit of routines by creating the <a href="https://github.com/spacetelescope/exovetter"> exovetter package </a>.
							</p>
							<p>
							<b>TESS Transit Hunt</b><br>The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satelite is doing a shallow photometric, time series survey. We are searching the Full Frame Images from TESS for signals consistent with exoplanets transiting their host stars. These exoplanets will be followed up to determine their mass and atmospheric composition, by groups like <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/~stargate/">STARGATE</a>
							</p>
							<p>
								<b> Standard Star Vetting with TESS</b> <br> We looked at the future JWST calibration stars with TESS to make sure they were photometrically stable. We identified several stars on the candidate calibration list that had variability larger than half a percent.  <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220103670M/abstract">ADS Paper Link </a>
							</p>
							<p>
							<b> Heartbeat Stars</b><br>Binary stars in highly eccentric orbits can approach each other causing the stars to heat-up and change shape. These tidally interacting stars can also drive the stars to pulsate. In the future we hope to use these pulsations to better understand the structure and evolution of stars.
